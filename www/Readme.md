#Concept Forge
#A Concept Generator App
##Description
A fully designed functional list randomizing app tailored for creatives. The app will use algorythms to create randomly generated combinations of words. It will allow an infinite number of word combinations for extended customization. Users can choose from pre-made lists or generate their own lists. The website is designed to help creatives stay sharp with their medium or practice of choice. It will be free to use.

##How It Works
The app pulls a random word from wordlists chosen by the user. Wordlists can be anything from descriptive (running, ugly, blue, wrinkled, etc.) to a name, place, organization, or creature (pirate, forest, incorporated). The website then places a specified random number of words in the order chosen by the user. For example, if the user chooses from, Colors/Occupations/Animals, he or she could receive Blue/Fish/Pirate. If the user selects, Moods/Birds/Organizations, he or she could receive Angry/Toucan/Diner. The user can then incorporate this element into a sketch, painting, creative writing exercise, etc. The only limit is the imagination of the creative person. Users will be able to choose an infinite number of categories, but use as little as 2 if desired.

##Ultimate Goal
The ultimate goal of this project will be to have both a website and an app available for free use by anyone. The website will be the litmus test to determine if the app can be a success. The app will not be a part of the class project, but must be taken into consideration when designing the website itself.
